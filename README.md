Welcome to Elijah's GitHub 👋

Hey there, I'm Elijah! Thanks for dropping by. This repository primarily showcases my academic work from college. However, there are a few projects I'm particularly excited about:

🤖 My Discord Bot: Dive in to see the features and functionalities I've implemented.

🏫 School Work: Check out the cool projects that I've gotten to do as a part of my education!

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect!
